# Pig-game
## A game using HTML CSS and JavaScript for learning work with DOM manipulation, Events, and the use of flowchart

In the pig game, we use a simple flowchart to break a large task into smaller ones.

GAME RULES:
+ The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
+ In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his Current score.
+ But, if the player rolls a 1, all his CURRENT score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn.
+ The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his CURRENT score gets added to his TOTAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn.
+ The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game.
